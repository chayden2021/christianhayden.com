                I just graduated from college. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Before starting my current company, I worked at several startups where I learned that the most
                interesting problems aren't technicalâ€”they're about understanding human behavior and building systems
                that work with human nature rather than against it.
              </p>

              <p>
                I write about startups, technology, and the craft of building software. My essays explore the
                intersection of human psychology and digital systems, with a focus on how we can create technology that
                makes people more capable and creative.
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm not writing or coding, I enjoy reading history, hiking in the Bay Area, and experimenting with
                new programming languages. I'm particularly interested in how historical patterns of innovation can
                inform how we build technology today.
              </p>

              <p>
                I studied Computer Science at Stanford, where I first became fascinated by the gap between how we think
                computers should work and how humans actually use them. This tension continues to drive much of my work
                and writing.
