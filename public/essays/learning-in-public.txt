Learning in Public

One of the best career decisions I ever made was to start learning in publicâ€”sharing what I was learning as I learned it, rather than waiting until I was an expert.

This felt uncomfortable at first. Who was I to teach others when I was still figuring things out myself? But I discovered something counterintuitive: you don't need to be an expert to help others. You just need to be one step ahead.

When you're learning something new, you remember what it's like to be confused. You remember which explanations clicked and which didn't. Experts often forget this. They've internalized so much knowledge that they can't remember what it was like not to know.

Learning in public also accelerates your own learning. When you try to explain something, you quickly discover the gaps in your understanding. Teaching forces you to think more clearly and organize your knowledge better.

But the real magic happens in the connections you make. When you share your learning journey, you attract other people who are interested in the same things. Some are ahead of you and can help. Others are behind you and you can help them. These relationships are incredibly valuable.

I've gotten job opportunities, collaborators, and friends through learning in public. None of this would have happened if I had kept my learning private.

The internet rewards people who share useful knowledge. It doesn't matter if you're not the world's leading expert. If you can help one person understand something better, you've created value.

Start small. Write about what you learned today. Share a useful resource you found. Explain a concept that confused you until recently. Don't worry about being perfect. Worry about being helpful.

The best time to start learning in public was yesterday. The second best time is now.
