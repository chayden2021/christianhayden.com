The Future of Work

Remote work isn't just a pandemic response anymore—it's a fundamental shift in how we think about work itself.

I've been working remotely for several years now, and I've noticed something interesting: the companies that succeed with remote work aren't just replicating office culture online. They're rethinking work from first principles.

In an office, presence equals productivity. If you're at your desk, you're working. But remote work forces us to measure actual output instead of time spent. This is uncomfortable for managers who are used to managing by observation, but it's better for everyone.

Remote work also changes how we collaborate. Instead of quick hallway conversations, we write things down. Instead of impromptu meetings, we plan asynchronously. This creates better documentation and more thoughtful communication.

But remote work isn't perfect. It can be isolating. It requires more discipline. And it makes certain types of collaboration harder—the kind of spontaneous creativity that happens when smart people are in the same room.

The future probably isn't fully remote or fully in-person. It's hybrid, but not in the way most companies are implementing it. Instead of "three days in the office," the future is about choosing the right mode for the right work.

Need to brainstorm? Get together in person. Need to focus? Work from home. Need to build relationships? Meet face-to-face. Need to execute on a plan? Work wherever you're most productive.

The companies that figure this out will have a huge advantage in attracting talent. The ones that don't will be stuck fighting over the subset of workers who want to commute to an office every day.

Work is changing. The question is whether we'll change with it.
