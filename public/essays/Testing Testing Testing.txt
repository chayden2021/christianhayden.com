For years, I've had a strong urge to put thoughts into writing. With three notes apps on my phone and countless journals of various shapes and sizes scattered around, each vessel is filled to the brim with inspired words, minor epiphanies, frustrated questions, and cool stories. 

However, until now my writing is mostly like one of those midnight "snacks" that turns into a whole meal worth of calories: a few crackers, some sliced ham from the fridge, and maybe a little peanut butter spread on a banana to finish it off. Sure, it's satisfying in the moment and certainly gets the job done, but it never makes too much sense when you go back and think about it later. Without an audience to write for, or at least an imagined one, my writing has been similarly disorganized. Sure, jotting is useful, but I'd also like to make complete and readable work more akin to the well-rounded dinner we should have had if we took the time to put conscious effort into our dietary decisions that evening. 

Thus, the purpose of sticking these words into a tiny crevice of the internet is to encourage that quality of careful thought by way of the possibly of even one person reading it in the future. If that person does happen to find it interesting or helpful, then that's even better!
