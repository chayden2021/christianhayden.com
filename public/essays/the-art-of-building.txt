The Art of Building

Building something meaningful is both an art and a science. It requires technical skill, but also intuition about what people actually need.

I've noticed that the best builders share a common trait: they're obsessed with understanding the problem before they start building the solution. They spend time with users, they ask questions, and they resist the urge to jump straight into code.

This is harder than it sounds. When you're excited about a technical solution, it's tempting to assume the problem is obvious. But problems are rarely obvious. They're hidden beneath layers of workarounds, assumptions, and "that's just how things work."

The best products I've seen came from teams that spent months understanding a problem before writing a single line of code. They talked to users, observed workflows, and identified the real pain points—not just the obvious ones.

Once you understand the problem deeply, the solution often becomes clear. Not easy, but clear. You know what to build and, more importantly, what not to build.

This is why I think building is an art. It's not just about technical execution—it's about seeing what others miss, understanding what people really need, and having the discipline to build only what matters.

The best builders are part detective, part artist, part engineer. They solve mysteries, create experiences, and make things work. It's a beautiful combination when done well.
